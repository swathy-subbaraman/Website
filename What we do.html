<h5 style="margin-left:15px;"><br><br>Education is a powerful driver of development and one of the strongest instruments for reducing poverty and improving health, gender equality & peace.
We, The Aashraya Charitable Society, believe that education is one of the crucial factor which can change the fate of a nation. Thus, we put our best step
forward in educating young minds across the country, with the books that are received as donations and new books are bought every year. The Aashraya Charitable Society
has adopted 10 schools in the State of Tamilnadu, in the districts of Kanchipuram, Madurai, Kanniyakumari and Nilgiris. We are proud that these schools which were in a 
pathetic condition, were renovated, chairs and benches that were in cracks were all replaced, and new amenities like Laboratories, were all done exclusively by
The Aashraya Charitable Society. The above mentioned schools were adopted in the year of 2020 and are still under our maintenance. We are expanding our territory
and serving many bright students and are looking forward to adopt more schools in the future.</h5><br><br><br><br>
