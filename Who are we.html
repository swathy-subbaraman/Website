<h3 style="margin-top:50px;"> Initiative</h3>
<pre><i>It doesnâ€™t matter how strong a person is, 
it is important to see how many people are lifted up
 during their crucial situations with that power. 
 This charitable society is started in the name of
 <q>Aashraya</q>, which means "Shelter" in Sanskrit
 with a mission to serve for this humanity in 2022
 by Shivani Suresh, R.B.Shyamala and Swathy K.S.</pre></i><br>
<h3 style="margin-left:55px;">What we focus on?</h3>

<pre style="margin-left:55px;"><i>Being Human is the primary slogan of this society. Without focusing on caste, race, or language, support has been extended
to the struggling lives in the society. We,The Aashraya Charitable Trust, take an oath to serve and support every life 
with all the might we have.</pre></i>

<h3 style="margin-left:55px;">How is your fund used?</h3>
<pre style="margin-left:55px;"><i>The amount that is donated, is distributed to various orphanages that are under the wing of Aashraya Charitable Trust, who in turn,
use it for the food,cloth and educational expenses of the young minds and other medical expenses of senior citizens. This money is 
also spent for health camps,blood donation camps and various other awareness camps. People below the poverty line, who seek medical help
are funded with the donations collected, thus saving many lives. Apart from collecting money, we collect food, used clothes and books,
which are sent to many orphanages to feed, clothe and educate the children there. This facility is open only to major cities and we are
trying to bring it up to other cities in the nation. </pre></i>
